# Tuinue Wasichana

## Project Overview

**Tuinue Wasichana** is a full-stack platform designed to support menstrual hygiene for school-going girls in Sub-Saharan Africa. This initiative addresses the barriers to education that arise when girls miss school due to a lack of access to sanitary products. Through recurring and one-time donations, the platform ensures girls can attend school without interruption due to menstruation.

### Project Mission

- **Empowerment**: Enabling girls to stay in school, improve their educational outcomes, and break the cycle of poverty.
- **Sustainability**: Providing donors with the opportunity to set up recurring donations that will continue to support the cause.

## Features

- **Recurring and One-time Donations**: Donors can set up automated recurring donations or make one-time contributions.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Registration, login, and password management to ensure donor security.
- **Impactful Imagery and Content**: Hero sections, empowering imagery, and engaging content to highlight the mission of menstrual hygiene support.
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Fully responsive design to provide a seamless user experience across mobile devices.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL database for managing donor data, transactions, and other critical platform details.

## Languages & Technologies Used

### **Frontend**

- **JavaScript**: The core programming language for the frontend logic and interactivity.
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, specifically used for creating the dynamic, single-page web application.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A state management library that provides predictable state containers for the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing modern, responsive layouts with minimal effort.
- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the content of web pages.
- **CSS3**: Stylesheets used for customizing the look and feel of the application.

### **Backend**

- **Python**: The backend programming language used for the server-side logic.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building APIs and web services with Python, used to handle routes and the application's core logic.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system used to store donor information, transaction history, and other critical data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A Python SQL toolkit and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for database interaction.

### **Testing**

- **Jest**: A testing framework for JavaScript, used to write unit and integration tests for the frontend.
- **Minitest**: A lightweight testing framework for Ruby, used for testing the backend logic (if applicable) and ensuring code quality.

### **Payments Integration**

- **PayPal**: A secure payment gateway integrated to handle donation transactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: Install Node.js for running JavaScript on the server side and managing the frontend development.
   - Download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed for running the backend server.
   - Download from [Python](https://www.python.org/)
3. **PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL to handle the backend database.
   - Download from [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Setting up the Backend

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/tuinue-wasichana-cci.git
   cd tuinue-wasichana-cci/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure the connection settings (you may need to adjust database connection parameters in the `config.py` file).

5. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python don.py
   ```

### Setting up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will start the React development server, and you can access the platform by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running Tests

- **Frontend (Jest)**:
  To run tests for the frontend, use:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- **Backend (Minitest)**:
  To run backend tests, use:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover
  ```
